# Style_annotation_prod
The script applies LLM to automate furniture style annotation.
Given a furniture piece, the script can judge whether another furniture piece is stylistically compatible with it.
The script has 2 modes:
  (1) compare mode: compare LLM annotation vs. human annotation
  (2) evaluate mode: run evaluation on an unlabeled dataset and report % 'Yes'
You can change the mode argument in the config.yaml file.
