The mirror has a more glamorous, cool-toned mosaic look, while the towel's multi-colored pom-poms and warm tones create a playful, almost juvenile feel.

The shower curtain is bold, abstract, and maximalist with a vibrant, multi-colored palette. The lotion pump is traditional and delicate with a muted, limited color scheme. The two styles would clash and create a visually jarring and incoherent bathroom aesthetic."

The trash can, while also French-inspired, is highly rustic and distressed. The clash in formality between the polished, refined vanity and the rugged, weathered metal of the trash can would create a jarring aesthetic."
