VGX17972,Byrum - Mid-century Modern Wenge Dining Set,https://secure.img1-fg.wfcdn.com/lf/unprocessed/hash/0/306063949/1/c.jpg,MCRW8258,Galligan Upholstered Side Chair,https://secure.img1-fg.wfcdn.com/lf/unprocessed/hash/0/38650414/1/c.jpg,No,No,"While both items are labeled as mid-century modern, their aesthetics clash significantly. The Byrum set features a dark wenge finish and fully upholstered grey chairs, creating a substantial, contemporary look. The Galligan chairs, with their light natural wood finish and black faux leather seats, have a much lighter, more classic Scandinavian-MCM feel. The contrasting wood tones and chair styles would create a jarring and incoherent dining space."

The wall art is ornate and colorful with its blue, gold, and jewel-like details, while the cutting board is a simple, graphic, black-and-cream herringbone pattern. The conflicting color palettes and styles would create a visual clash."
