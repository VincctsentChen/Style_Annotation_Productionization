The vanity's slatted shelf and apron-front sink are complemented by the wall cabinet's rustic wood finish and sliding barn door.

The light fixture's heavily distressed ""silver foil"" finish is much more rustic and industrial, and it would clash with the sleek, refined look of the vanity and its hardware."

The styles, while both bold and patterned, are too different to create a cohesive look; the mirror is more Art Deco/Glam, while the towel is distinctly Bohemian."

The shower curtain is bold, abstract, and vibrantly multi-colored, creating a maximalist, modern feel. In contrast, the lotion pump is delicate, traditional, and features a muted, subtle color palette. The visual clash between the two styles would be jarring and incoherent."
