While the cabinet has a classic coastal/farmhouse feel and the accessories are more modern and playful, the shared color allows them to complement each other in a layered, eclectic bathroom design."

The wood base of the accessories can tie into wood flooring or other accents, creating a cohesive and sophisticated organic modern or Japandi-style bathroom."

The light, yellow-toned bamboo of the accessory set clashes with the warm, reddish-brown wood of the Mid-Century Modern vanity. Additionally, the brushed steel pump on the soap dispenser conflicts with the vanity's brass hardware."

The over-the-toilet storage has a contemporary, almost Japandi feel with its dark gray finish and vertical fluting. The vanity, with its walnut finish, splayed legs, and cane webbing, is distinctly Mid-Century Modern/Boho. The combination of dark gray, walnut, and light cane creates a visually busy and disjointed look rather than a cohesive one."

The first cabinet's light gray, painted finish and glass doors give it a traditional, cottage-like feel, whereas the second cabinet's dark, rustic wood-grain finish and modern hardware create a distinctly different, more contemporary farmhouse aesthetic. Placed together, their contrasting colors and styles would clash."

The vanity's rustic, dark charcoal wood grain and black industrial hardware conflict with the smooth, solid navy blue finish and simple cutout handles of the storage cabinet. The combination of different wood textures, colors, and hardware styles would create a visually disjointed and non-cohesive look in a bathroom."
