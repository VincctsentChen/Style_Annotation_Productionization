The light, yellow-toned bamboo of the accessory set clashes with the warm, reddish-brown wood of the Mid-Century Modern vanity. Additionally, the brushed steel pump on the soap dispenser conflicts with the vanity's brass hardware."

The over-the-toilet storage has a contemporary, almost Japandi feel with its dark gray finish and vertical fluting. The vanity, with its walnut finish, splayed legs, and cane webbing, is distinctly Mid-Century Modern/Boho. The combination of dark gray, walnut, and light cane creates a visually busy and disjointed look rather than a cohesive one."
